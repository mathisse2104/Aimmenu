# 🎯 AIM Menu – Custom Third-Person Aiming Styles

The AIM Menu lets players switch between unique third-person aiming styles for a personalized combat experience.  
Designed for FiveM servers using the **ESX framework**, this system adds flexibility and immersion to how players handle firearms.

## ℹ️ How It Works

1. **Automatic First Person on Aim**  
   Players are automatically placed into **first-person view when aiming**, ensuring a consistent and precise experience.

2. **Optional: Use `/aimtoggle`**  
   Players can use the `/aimtoggle` command to **disable automatic first-person** and switch to third-person aiming instead.

3. **Choose Your Aiming Style**  
   Use `/aimmenu` to open the AIM Menu and select one of the available third-person aiming styles.
